# Portfolio
A portfolio of work to showcase my skills.

## Description
The purpose of this project was to put together a portfolio to showcase my skills and abilities that hopefully will impress future employers. The portfolio is currently in process of completion and will continue to have information and designs being updated. 

## Portfolio goals
Future things I would like to add and improve in my portfolio are, an image of myself, a description about me, links to projects I've worked on, intricate and aesthetically pleasing web layout and design, a link to my updated resume, smooth page transitions when changing screen size, etc. More ideas to come!
